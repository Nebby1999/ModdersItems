# ModdersItems
 A collection of custom Risk of Rain 2 items based off of community modders, much like how vanilla has developer items (Ghor's Tome, Paul's Goat Hoof).

# Contributing
This mod is a [ThunderKit Project](https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit), and also makes use of [Moonstorm Shared Utils](https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/MoonstormSharedUtils/) to handle the project.

Contribution can be done through forking this project and creating a [pull request](https://github.com/Vale-X/ModdersItems/pulls) between this project and the fork, much like R2API. Please follow the folder structure within the Unity Project, using your name for folders within the `AssetBundle`, `Scripts`, and `Source` folders. ItemDefs, BuffDefs, etc are added by the MSU Module Bases automatically. The `TokenBase` class is used to add your own set of tokens to the game, and was made for this project. Check out `ValeTokens` for example usage.

For an example of an item, check out the `Vale` folders within `AssetBundle`, `Scripts` and `Source`. (Item works but is WIP).

Since this is a thunderkit project, once you clone this repository you need to open the project, and in the thunderkit settings, locate the RoR2 executable in your pc.

Any questions regarding the systems in MSU should be redirected to Nebby.
